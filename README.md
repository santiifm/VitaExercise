# README

This is my little wallet API with user creation and transactions between BTC and USD for Vita Wallet.

The project was done in Ruby 3.3.3 and rails 7.1.3.4 and deployed in Render for easy access.

Things to take into account:
 - As the render instance is free it may spin-down and the first request may take a minute or return a time-out.
 - When creating a user it by default will have 200 of whatever currency you choose to trade in.
 - Rspec suite can be run with the 'rspec' command.
 - The API documentation has been done with Swagger/OpenApi and is located in /api-docs.

I hope this project has been satisfactory and I'm looking forward to working with you :)
